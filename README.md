# MToolBox-snakemake

**MToolBox** is a pipeline for SNP calling and annotation in mitochondrial genomes. Since its [first publication in 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25028726), it has been used in **>30 peer-reviewed clinical studies**. We have developed **MToolBox-snakemake**, a **new snakemake implementation**, which includes the [mtoolnote](https://github.com/mitoNGS/mtoolnote) module for variant functional annotation in order to facilitate its usage and to offer an integrated and user-friendly tool, with the aim of providing results, tables and plots ready to be discussed and used to drive downstream analyses and wet-lab experiments.

And with this new implementation, MToolBox is also capable of analysing also mt data from **other species**!

The official documentation of MToolBox-snakemake is available at https://mtoolbox-snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/sept_2020_doc/index.html.
