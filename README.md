# MToolBox: updates and snakemake implementation

**MToolBox** is a pipeline for SNP calling and annotation in mitochondrial genomes. Since its [first publication in 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25028726), it has been used in **>30 peer-reviewed clinical studies**. We have developed **MToolBox-snakemake**, a **new snakemake implementation**, which includes the [mtoolnote](https://github.com/mitoNGS/mtoolnote) module for variant functional annotation in order to facilitate its usage and to offer an integrated and user-friendly tool, with the aim of providing results, tables and plots ready to be discussed and used to drive downstream analyses and wet-lab experiments.

This is an work-in-progress update of [MToolBox](https://github.com/mitoNGS/MToolBox) ([PMID:25028726](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25028726/)). Please find more at [the official documentation](https://mtoolbox-snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/sept_2020_doc/index.html).
