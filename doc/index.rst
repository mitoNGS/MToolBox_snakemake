Welcome to the MToolBox-snakemake documentation!
================================================

**MToolBox** is a pipeline for SNP calling and annotation in mitochondrial genomes. `Since its first publication in 2014`_, it has been used in **>30 peer-reviewed clinical studies**. We have developed a **new snakemake implementation** (available `here`_), which includes the `mtoolnote`_ module for variant functional annotation in order to facilitate its usage and to offer an integrated and user-friendly tool, with the aim of providing results, tables and plots ready to be discussed and used to drive downstream analyses and wet-lab experiments.

And with this new implementation, MToolBox is also capable of analysing also mt data from **other species**!
